  pitch: The fiber scheduler presents new opportunities for building scalable and concurrent Ruby programs. However, Rails has traditionally been a request-per-process or request-per-thread framework. We will give a brief introduction to the fiber scheduler, and look at how we are evolving Rails and Ruby in general to take advantage of request-per-fiber using Falcon.

  pitch: If you're a programmer who has ever found themselves inadvertently (perhaps unwillingly!) straddling the line between design and code, this is the talk for you. Even with zero design training or background, there are numerous small, simple and practical ways you can vastly improve the look and usability of a website. In this talk, we'll explore 10 of them together, using research and proven solutions to see how the impact as a whole for both clients and users is greater than the sum of its parts.

    The Ruby community has a reputation across the wider tech industry for being a bit special - opinionated, yes, but also warm and welcoming. Our conferences, our events, even our code is so often a bit more thoughtful and a bit more fun, and the legacy of this has spread beyond Ruby to other language communities such as Elixir and Rust. We have every reason to be proud… yet, we should be wary of resting of our laurels.
    And when we look at the broader world - with pandemics, wars, and the devastation of the climate emergency - well, it's easy to become despondent, or to shut that out and focus on the code. But instead, we should tap into that special community vibe that has nurtured us, and take a step forward in having a broader impact. So what could that look like?
    To understand what we can (and perhaps should) do, we must understand what has been done already: this session will cast a critical eye on our industry, pointing out missteps and missed perspectives, as well as looking at what has been done elsewhere to make lasting, positive changes. With that foundation set, we will then talk through several recommendations on what meaningful action for software developers can be, as well as possible guidelines to help each other critique, share and refactor our actions to have even greater impact.

  pitch: |
    As much as Rails is all in on Convention over Configuration, there comes a point where there is just so much code, such intricate relationships between classes and such complex business requirements that conventions don't seem to fit anymore. It seems like the only solution is to abandon the Majestic Monolith and use micro services.
    However, there is an answer to this. An answer that's been there for a very long time, right under our noses. One that allows Ruby on Rails developers to keep growing a beautiful, sustainable and scalable Monoliths and ride with them to the sunset.
    The answer is Rails Engines.
    Like… Devise or Spree?
    Not quite. In this talk you'll learn a whole new perspctive on Rails Engines; a much lighter and leaner way to use them that allow teams to break up their app into meaningful modules without losing the beauty of Rails' conventions. Sprinkle in the Packwerk Gem by Shopify for the perfect combo to scale your domain and your team.

  pitch: |
      70% of people worldwide have felt like an imposter at some point in their career. 46% respondents to a women-in-tech survey agreed that help overcoming imposter syndrome would make them happier and more successful. Do you worry sometimes that you're not as smart as the other people in your organisation? Or that you won't be able to keep up and they'll find out that you don't really belong there? Do you stress out about living up to the expectations of the people you manage?
      People working in tech, including those in leadership positions, often struggle to overcome prejudice and lack of privilege but still end up feeling like they don't belong, like they are a fraud, even when they're achieving success and making an impact. Imposter syndrome can affect people at any stage in their career - whether they're an intern or in a senior leadership or executive role.
      In this talk I'll go over personal experiences with imposter syndrome and practical strategies I've developed that anyone can apply to banish imposter thoughts and prevent them from getting in the way of your success, career progression, mental health, and happiness at work. An easy to remember acronym (REACT) with 5 realistic steps you can take away and practice can help you create a more accurate representation of your performance. You can take these steps away for yourself, or if you are a people leader, use them to help coach your people through the confusing world of imposter syndrome.

  pitch: |
      Is thinking different such a bad thing? ...Let's look at the evolutionary theory behind neurodiversity. Would the human race even exist today if Neurodiversity wasn't engineered into the population? the answer is - Probably not! Why is that?
      How and why do modern teams benefit by actively including neurodiversity? More and more workplaces, such as the Australian Defence Force, are actively seeking out and including neurodiversity? They're offering supportive working environments to unlock their super powers! 
      Are you unknowingly suppressing the super powers of your neurodiverse colleagues by forcing them to conform to neurotypical expectations? Are you aware of their daily struggles due to workplaces and processes being built for neurotypicals? eg. do you offer pairing opportunities to help with task paralysis? or quiet working spaces? or attention to office lighting? or recorded Zoom meetings, etc? The chances are, if they are female - they might not be aware of their own needs! Did you know that the average age for ADHD diagnosis for anyone born male is single digits, and goes up to 45 for anyone born female?!
      Let's encourage more open conversations, and educate ourselves and our peers. Neurodiversity is not a disability - it's a super power from being wired differently. The benefits can be incredible when we become inclusive!

  pitch: In an age of algorithmic manipulation, surveillance capitalism, privacy erosion, rising fascism, and impending climate disaster, it's easy to fall prey to despair, to grimly accept our slide into an inevitable dystopian future. But there is another way. The philosophy of techno-optimism challenges us to imagine alternate futures in which technology helps promote broad social good. This talk applies a literary lens, by way of an early 20th century "future history" by H. G. Wells, to explore our evolving relationship with world-changing technologies, and help us imagine-- and build toward-- a future we can all not just survive in, but truly thrive in.

      Recently I've been working in Rails applications where protecting sensitive data is a priority. But keeping data secure sometimes comes at the cost of utility. The types of queries you can execute can be limited.
      In this talk, I'll share what I've been learning about application level encryption, and an encryption scheme called Order Revealing Encryption (ORE). ORE enables querying capabilities while still keeping data encrypted when in use. I'll be demonstrating ORE's capabilities using a toy ORE library that I have built in Ruby.

      Put yourself into the eyes of someone with autism… wait that's not how that goes, metaphors are hard. As someone who grew up in an autistic house, I knew we were different, but not why and what to do about it. After stumbling through life, here's what I'd like to share about autism. Wait, shoes!
      An in depth look into autism and how people with autism function in the workplace.
      This talk goes through:
      Personal history and experiences
      * I've been diagnosed for 15 years and majored psychology at university to learn more
      How autism is diagnosed including criteria and levels of autism
      * Including the history of autism
      * Debunking some common myths and stereotypes
      Strengths and weaknesses
      * Real life min/maxing
      Workplace consideration and accommodations
      * Asking people what they need and believing them helps everyone
      I'm hoping by sharing my experiences you'll be able to gain some insight on how to help others, or yourself if you identify with what I've been saying a little too much.
