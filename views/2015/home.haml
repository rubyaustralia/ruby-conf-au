      %h3 Testing Zero to Hero
      %h4 So testing&hellip; How does it work?

      %p What is a unit test? Why is that an integration test, should I even bother with acceptance tests?

      %p Let's work through the differences between the various types of testing, look at differing strategies for tackling problems and how they can be solved. Try doing things with TDD, try doing things building tests after.

      %p Let's use RSpec, TestUnit and MiniSpec to test different techniques and perfect our tests. And we will look at how we can apply these to our real world problems to make our lives easier and our software better!

      %h3 Building C Extensions in Ruby
      %h4 You will learn how amazingly simple it is to build high-performance extensions that leverage existing C libraries.

      %p You’ll receive a basic notion of the C language, and then you will dive into the various Ruby APIs that allow you to bridge C code to our favourite language.

      %p We will also go through a heavy testing component that will help you ensure that your extension works as intended, and remains as bulletproof as possible.

      %h4 Take the next step in your coding journey!

      %p Join us and continue the learning you started at Rails Girls. Since you have Ruby installed already, we can jump right in!

      %p We've organised three mentor-led tutorials that will help you dive deeper into the world of professional development with Ruby. Tutorials include a look at some of Ruby's more advanced features and syntax, building a Sinatra app and deploying it, test-driven development and more.

      %p Lastly, you will gain a greater appreciation of development work procedures by pairing up to solve coding challenges and using Git for version control.

        %em Workshop run by awesome volunteers!
        %p Our mentors have about three hundred years of combined awesomeness! They've wrestled furious dragons with code and walked away un-charred.

        %p
          Seriously though, our mentors are professional developers. They'll be on hand to answer all of your questions and help you out of tricky spots. See the list at the
