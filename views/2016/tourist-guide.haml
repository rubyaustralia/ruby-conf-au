    %h2 How do I get there?

    %p Gold Coast Airport is located in Coolangatta, at the southern end of the Gold Coast. Gold Coast Airport receives flights from most capital & regional cities, as well as New Zealand, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

    %p Flying into the Gold Coast Airport means you will have the option of catching the <a href="http://gcshuttle.com.au/" target="_blank">Gold Coast Tourist Shuttle</a>, which provides a door-to-door service to your hotel. This trip will take a minimum of 30 minutes depending on where you are staying, and will cost around $21 one way, or $41 return. You can also request a pick up at your hotel when flying home.

    %p Brisbane Airport has both a domestic and an international terminal, receiving flights from both Australian and international destinations.

    %p Flying into the Brisbane Airport means you will need to catch the <a href="https://www.airtrain.com.au/" target="_blank">Airtrain</a> to the Gold Coast. This trip normally takes about 1¾ hours and costs around $30 one way. The Airtrain departs Brisbane Airport every 15 minutes and runs express to the Gold Coast, connecting with bus services from Helensvale, Nerang and Robina train stations, which will take you into the heart of Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach.

    %h2 How do I get around?

    %p The Gold Coast now has its very own tramline, in addition to bus services. If you are staying anywhere from Broadbeach to Southport, then the <a href="http://ridetheg.com.au/" target="_blank">GLink</a> trams are your best option.

    %p To go directly to Sea World, both the 705 and 704 bus routes will drop you out the front of the park – see <a href="http://translink.com.au/" target="_blank">Translink</a> for timetables.

    %p All public transport tickets can be bought individually, however if you plan on catching a few, it will be easier to grab a <a href="https://gocard.translink.com.au/webtix/" target="_blank"><em>go</em> card</a>.

    %p If you’d prefer not to catch public transport, <a href="http://www.gccabs.com.au/" target="_blank">Gold Coast Cabs</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a> are also available.

    %h2 What to do and see?

    %h3 Beaches

    %p So a trip to the Gold Coast is not complete until you’ve seen our beautiful beaches – and everyone knows the iconic Surfers Paradise arch is a great spot for getting your tourist on, with <a href="http://www.surfersparadise.com/things-to-do/beachfront-markets" target="_blank">Beachfront Markets</a> on every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday night, and Cavill Mall comes alive with its cafes and restaurants every weekend!

    %p But did you know about the other beaches of the Gold Coast? If you’re looking for a more relaxed feel, check out Burleigh Heads, home of the iconic Quiksilver and Roxy Pro Competitions. This is a great spot for a relaxing walk along the beach, or a more energetic one along the esplanade. Heading north, you’ve got a short walk to the spectacular lookout of North Burleigh Hill, while heading south, you’ll find Justin Park, with a plethora of cafes with good coffee and tasty treats just behind it in the James Street shopping centre. Keep walking south along the esplanade and you’ll find the <a href="http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/burleigh-head/" target="_blank">Burleigh Headland National Park</a>. The two walking trails here (the Oceanview walk and the Rainforest circuit) will take you no more than 45 minutes to complete, but you may find yourself watching the view at Tumgun Lookout for quite a while!

    %p A little further north is another beach that’s popular with the locals – Nobbys Beach. Nobbys is fast becoming the hot spot on the coast for its popular cafes, restaurants and bars, all of which are only a stone’s throw from the beach that many a surfer names as their favourite. If you keep walking north along the beach from Nobbys, you will eventually hit the Spit just outside Sea World - Surfers Paradise – that’s around 40km of shoreline!

    %h3 Shopping

    %p The Gold Coast has a number of shopping centres where you can find a great bargain.
