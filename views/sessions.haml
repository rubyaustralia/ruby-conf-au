      %p
        We're hosting the conference schedule on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/rubyconf-australia/schedule/">Lanyrd</a>, which is a tried and tested solution for broadcasting conference schedules.

        Whilst at the conference you'll most likely want to use your smartphone to browse the schedule. If you have an iphone install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lanyrd/id467652813">Lanyrd iOS app</a>, alternatively and if you're on Android you can browse the schedule using the real smooth <a href="https://m.lanyrd.com/2013/rubyconf-australia/">html5 mobile app</a>.
